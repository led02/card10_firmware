/**
 * @file        main.c
 * @brief       Configures and starts the RTC and demonstrates the use of the alarms.
 * @details     The RTC is enabled and the sub-second alarm set to trigger every 250 ms.
 *              P2.25 (LED0) is toggled each time the sub-second alarm triggers.  The
 *              time-of-day alarm is set to 2 seconds.  When the time-of-day alarm
 *              triggers, the rate of the sub-second alarm is switched to 500 ms.  The
 *              time-of-day alarm is then rearmed for another 2 sec.  Pressing SW2 will
 *              output the current value of the RTC to the console UART.
